taxdictionaries
===============

Hunspell dictionaries for taxonomic names, created primarily for the taxspell R package (https://github.com/sckott/taxspell)

Right now the dictionary files have empty `.aff` files, and the `.dic` files have no rules.

- (plants) The Plant List data `tpl.dic`/`tpl.aff`
- (aquatic australian spp) Taxamatch test data set `taxamatch_ref.dic`/`taxamatch_ref.aff`
